            A Surprising Twist
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Surprisingly, my journey to where I am today took an unexpected turn. I graduated with a degree in law, a field that I initially pursued with great enthusiasm. However, life often has its own plans. Due to family reasons, I found myself relocating to Germany, where I encountered an unforeseen challenge: my legal education and expertise were not directly transferrable to the German legal system.
