            Surprisingly, I started off on a different path altogether. I got my
            degree in law and was super enthusiastic about it. But as fate would
            have it, life decided to shake things up a bit. Due to some family
            reasons, I found myself in Germany, and bam! My legal expertise did
            not quite fit the local legal puzzle.
